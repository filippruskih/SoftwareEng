<h1>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</h1>
<h2>By Samuel Taylor Coleridge</h2>

<hr>
<p>
&nbsp;  It is an ancient Mariner,
<br>And he stoppeth one of three.
<br>'By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
<br>Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?

<br> 
&nbsp;  The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,
<br>And I am next of kin;
<br>The guests are met, the feast is set:
<br>May'st hear the merry din.'

<li>It's just two verses</li>
<li>But I'd recommend reading the rest!</li>
